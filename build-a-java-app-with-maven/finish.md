Well done! You've just used Jenkins to build a simple Java application with
Maven!

The "Build", "Test" and "Deliver" stages you created above are the basis for
building more complex Java applications with Maven in Jenkins, as well as Java
and Maven applications that integrate with other technology stacks.

Because Jenkins is extremely extensible, it can be modified and configured to
handle practically any aspect of build orchestration and automation.
